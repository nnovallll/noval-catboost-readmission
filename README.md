# noval-catboost-readmission

Classification model for predicting hospital readmission in diabetic patients using CatBoost. This project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and handling of class imbalance to improve model performance.

## Features

- Utilizes CatBoost for robust classification
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering for improved prediction accuracy
- Techniques to handle class imbalance

## Repository Structure

- `Skripsi_Draft13_Versi_Rapi(1).ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis, modeling, and evaluation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nnovallll/noval-catboost-readmission.git
    ```
2. Open the notebook in JupyterLab or any compatible environment.
3. Run the cells to process data and build the CatBoost model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- catboost
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy

Install requirements via pip:
```bash
pip install catboost pandas scikit-learn numpy
```

## Usage

Modify the notebook as needed for your data or research. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, train, and evaluate the model.

## License

This project currently does not have a license.
